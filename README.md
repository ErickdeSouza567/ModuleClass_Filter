Solving a real problem for the company, which had no way to filter classes within its API and did not even have access to edit it in the department where I worked, as control was with an external company. So, I created this code using my knowledge of Python and Pandas to filter all existing classes based on the data obtained from the API. It compares an Excel file where students retrieved through some request were stored, processes the table's columns, finds modules, identifies subjects associated with these modules, and determines the city responsible for each module. Using my expertise, I solved a major company issue without needing direct access to the API code to create the filter. Instead, I built an external filter, addressing a real problem, improving efficiency, and enhancing the educational control process in the department where I worked as a systems analyst.
